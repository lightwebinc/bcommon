"""Generate LICENSE-THIRD-PARTY for a Go repository, from what it actually links.

Why this exists rather than a hand-written file: nearly every licence a Go
binary pulls in requires its own text to travel with a BINARY distribution, not
only with source. Apache-2.0 section 4 requires a copy of the licence be given
to recipients of the Work; MIT requires the notice "in all copies or
substantial portions"; BSD-3 requires binary redistributions to reproduce the
notice; Open BSV requires its text and an attribution line. Static linking
discards every one of those files, so an image built from a Go binary carries
the code and none of the notices.

A hand-written list goes stale silently the first time a dependency is added.
This reads `go list -deps`, so it describes the artefact rather than someone's
memory of it.

Handles both a Go module and an npm package. The Go side reads `go list -deps`,
so a module in go.mod that nothing imports is correctly absent and an INDIRECT
dependency that IS imported is correctly present. The npm side reads
`npm ls --omit=dev --omit=peer --all`, which is the tree an install of the
package brings with it; a peer dependency is the installer's own.

Usage:  gen-third-party-licenses.py <repo-dir> [--check]
        --check exits 1 if the file on disk differs from what would be written.
